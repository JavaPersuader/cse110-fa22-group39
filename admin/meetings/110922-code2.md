## Agenda 
1. Measure app performance: **Response** (process events in under 50ms) and **Load**(deliver content and become interactive in under 5 seconds)
    - Both can be manually measured using Chrome DevTools. Load : In the performance tab, click "Start profiling and reload page" and look at the "Summary" tab for page loading time. Response : In the performance tab, click "Record"; interact somehow with the website (e.g. click the button); click "Stop"; look at the "Event Log" tab for the corresponding event. You can search for a particular event (e.g. onclick) in the "Filter" textfield.
